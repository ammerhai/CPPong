# CPPong

This little project is going to be a "Pong"-Game which get smaller and bigger updates in the future, like Multiplayer etc.
By doing this I use this webseries: https://handmadehero.org/, to build the game in way to learn how to program in a good way
and to find out what is possible while using C++.
